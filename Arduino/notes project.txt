API needs internet and connect to internet

type word
send word to computer
small program will receive word 
call dictionary API to define word
computer recieve response
send response and print to arduino


two parts

part 1:
convert handwritted word into text


part 2:
calling internet API and getting meaning

can do both lcd and speaker
pronunciation is very helpful speaker is a better idea

wav file play in speaker

API is application programming interface- its live data
library is embed in program. ei. list of words and meanings which is limited to content

can use entire power of computer because it's listener





need a backup idea:
	use library for like 20 words and define just those with buttons
	button game where student can change between x amunt of words and see their definition
	
basic:
v1
type input
call api
send to speaker

v2
add module to text recog to v1

v3
add audio and lcd display of meaning to v2
